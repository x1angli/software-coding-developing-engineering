This article contains random, unorganized notes about Golang

### Slices are like references to arrays
Unlike Python, where slices are clones of the original arrays, Golang's slices are array references Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array.

And, the capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice. So, the `cap(s)` is always the length of the underlying array.

```
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    names := [4]string{
        "John",
        "Paul",
        "George",
        "Ringo",
    }

    a := names[0:2]
    b := names[1:3]

    b[0] = "XXX"
    fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

### Structure references
It's tricky. The special prefix & returns a pointer to the struct value. But, To access the field X of a struct when we have the struct pointer p we could write (*p).X. However, that notation is cumbersome, so the language permits us instead to write just p.X, without the explicit dereference.

```
package main
import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
    X, Y int
}

var (
    v = Vertex{1, 2}
    p1 = &v
    p2  = &Vertex{1, 2} // has type *Vertex
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(v)
    p1.X = 1e9  // note here
    fmt.Println(p1)
    fmt.Println(p2)
}
```

### Stacking defers
Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out(LIFO) order.

### Switch
* Switch cases evaluate cases from top to bottom, stopping when a case succeeds.
* Equivalently, Go's switch cases need not be constants, and the values involved need not be integers.
* Golang does NOT need to "break" cases. In effect, the break statement that is needed at the end of each case in those languages is provided automatically in Golang.

### "for" is Go's "while"
C's while is spelled for in Go.

```
    sum := 1
    for sum < 1000 {
        sum += sum
    }
    fmt.Println(sum)
```

### Named return falues for function
```
func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
    x = sum * 4 / 9
    y = sum - x
    return
}
```

### Exported names
In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter

### Loop iterates
The `range` form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map.

```
package main
import "fmt"

var pow = []int{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}
func main() {
    for i, v := range pow {
        fmt.Printf("2**%d = %d\n", i, v)
    }
    for _, value := range pow {
        fmt.Printf("%d\n", value)
    }

}
```

#### Test that a key in a map:
Test that a key is present in a map with a two-value assignment:
```elem, ok = m[key]```
If `key` is in `m`, `ok` is `true`. If not, `ok` is `false`.

### receiver methods
Go does not have classes. However, you can define methods on types. A method is a function with a special receiver argument.The receiver appears in its own argument list between the `func` keyword and the method name.

    func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
        return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
    }
    var v Vertex
    v.Scale(5)  // OK
    p := &v
    p.Scale(10) // OK

#### pointer receiver methods
Methods with pointer receivers can modify the value to which the receiver points (as Scale does here). Since methods often need to modify their receiver, pointer receivers are more common than value receivers.

    func (v *Vertex) Scale(f float64) {
        v.X = v.X * f
        v.Y = v.Y * f
    }
    var v Vertex
    ScaleFunc(v, 5)  // Compile error!
    ScaleFunc(&v, 5) // OK
